> Transform SVG files into React components, Native and/or Web, JavaScript and
> ReasonML. Without shitload of dependencies.

## Install

```console
npm install react-from-svg

# or

yarn add react-from-svg
```

## Usage

```console
react-from-svg --help

Usage
    $ react-from-svg <sourcePath> <outputPath> [--with-native|--with-web]

  Options
    --with-native, -native                Output code for react-native-svg
    --with-web, -web                      Output code for DOM. If --with-native is also used, will be output as .web.js files
    --with-native-for-reason, -bsnative   Output code for @reason-react-native/svg
    --with-web-for-reason, -bsnweb        Output code for reason-react
    --remove-fill, -rf                    Remove all 'fill' properties from SVGs, convenient for icons
    --remove-stroke, -rs                  Remove all 'stroke' properties from SVGs, convenient for icons
    --commonjs, -cjs                      Export as commonjs instead of es6 import/export

  Example
    $ react-from-svg assets/svgs src/Svgs --with-native --remove-fill
```

Generated components will have the following props that you can inject to the
SVG components:

- `width`
- `height`
- `fill` (can be removed with `--remove-fill`)
- `stroke` (can be removed with `--remove-stroke`)
