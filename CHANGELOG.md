### Breaking change for all users

Some alias have been replaced. Please check the README for more information.

### Breaking change for user of `--with-**-reason` options

ReasonML output has been replaced by ReScript. This means:

- `--with-native-for-reason` has been replaced by `--with-native-for-rescript`
- `--with-web-for-reason` has been replaced by `--with-web-for-rescript`

Output is now ReScript code that works with `@rescript/react`, `rescript-react-native` and `@rescript-react-native/svg`.

See <https://rescript-react-native.github.io/blog/2021-05-04-hello-rescript-react-native> for more informations.

## 4.0.0 - 2020-04-16

In addition to some fixes, this release introduce a breaking change for the CLI.
Now you must use one of the `--with-*` options options to have output for you desired platform/language:

- `--with-native`: Output code using React Native & `react-native-svg` (compatible with React Native Web)
- `--with-web`: Output code using React DOM. If `--with-native` is also used, will be output as `.web.js` files
- `--with-native-for-reason`: Output code for Reason React Native & `@reason-react-native/svg`
- `--with-web-for-reason`: Output code for Reason React DOM

CLI has also been improved a little to be more gentle & can offer some `--help`.

Also, now, no `postinstall` step are necessary for this package as we ship a bundled version.

  This change make sense as you can now directly output reason code that are directly svgs, not just bindings (see `--with*-for-reason` new options).
